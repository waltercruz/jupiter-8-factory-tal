# Jupiter 8 factory patches for TAL J-8

 My reference was mainly the Arturia Jup-8 V4 and the patch sheets available [here](http://www.synthmania.com/Roland%20Jupiter-8/Images/Roland%20Jupiter-8%20Factory%20patch%20sheets.pdf) .

Patches were matched first against Arturia Jup-8 V4, and in some cases I went to the original patch sheets, when I had doubts.

Not everything is perfect. Copying patches is somewhat boring, so in the FX patches I just went lazy. But in everything that matters (the musical patches), I did the best to match them. 

Remember that TAL J-8 is indeed more powerful than JP-8 and these patches doesn't really shows all the strengths of TAL J-8.
