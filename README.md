# Jupiter 8 factory patches *almost complete* for TAL J-8

TAL J-8 includes some (24), but not all of the original JP-8 factory patches (64), so I copied these patches and began adding the missing ones. My reference was mainly the Arturia Jup-8 V4 (which includes all of the JP-8 factory) and the patch sheets available [here](http://www.synthmania.com/Roland%20Jupiter-8/Images/Roland%20Jupiter-8%20Factory%20patch%20sheets.pdf) .

Right now, the following patches are missing:

 - 54 Birds
 - 58 Gong
 - 62 Poly Rhythms
 - 63 Klingons
 - 64 Music of the Spheres
 - 66 Solar Winds
 - 68 Handclaps

I'm not sure if I will finish these.

Patches were matched first against Arturia Jup-8 V4, and in some cases I went to the original patch sheets, when I had doubts.

So, have fun, play some nice songs. And remember that TAL J-8 is indeed more powerful than JP-8 and these patches doesn't really shows all the strengths of TAL.
